                You will be playing a number guessing game for {{ session.config.num_rounds }} rounds.

            <h6>How to Play:</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>In each round, you will guess a number between 0 and 100.</li>
                <li>You will have 10 seconds to make your guess.</li>
                <li>A random target number will be generated.</li>
                <li>Your score for each round is the absolute difference between your guess and the target number.</li>
                <li>If you don't answer within the time limit, a value of 100 will be assigned as your guess.</li>
                <li>The player with the lowest total score (closest guesses) across all rounds will win.</li>
            </ul>
